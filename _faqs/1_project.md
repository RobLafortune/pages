question: "What’s a project?"
---

A project can be a public or private GitHub repository, or a local node project tested via the CLI, that you are monitoring with Snyk. We’ll track each project for vulnerabilities, and alert you when there’s a security risk, as well as when a new upgrade or patches to secure your project are available.
