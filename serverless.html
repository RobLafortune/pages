  - quote: "The most efficient way to solve a vulnerability is to do it as soon as possible. The mere notion of stopping for a security audit is just not feasible in todayâ€™s continuous world of software development. Snyk matches how we work by addressing and solving vulnerability issues during the development process itself."
