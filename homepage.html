# Testimonials. Do not include the quote mark in the testimonial. Short bit of plaintext only, no multi-paragraphs or links. Image must be square
testimonial-quote: "The most efficient way to solve a vulnerability is to do it as soon as possible. The mere notion of stopping for a security audit is just not feasible in today’s continuous world of software development. Snyk matches how we work by addressing and solving vulnerability issues during the development process itself."
